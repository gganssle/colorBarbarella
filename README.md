# colorBarbarella

This is just a collection of colorbars I use in IHS Kingdom. Because Kingdom foolishly uses a proprietary data format for their colorbars it's difficult to share them. They also don't have the cleverest of bars, so I built this repo to share some bars I like to use. I rebuilt a couple of the Matplotlib color bars here which exhibit perceptual uniformity (as of 20161107 this includes only Inferno and Viridis).
